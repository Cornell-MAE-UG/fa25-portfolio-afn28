# Mechanical Removal of Spotted Lanternfly Egg Masses
**Team:** Blue Team
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

## Problem statement
Vineyard managers attempt to **eradicate Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) populations** during the **dormant season (Sept-May)**, but **manual scraping is inefficient, dangerous at heights, and unreliable**. The core challenge is that **egg masses adhere strongly to uneven surfaces** and are located **above reachable heights 98% of the time [2]**, making them inaccessible without ladders or heavy equipment that cannot navigate vineyard rows.

## Impact
Solving this reduces the **multi-million dollar threat** to the grape industry [1] by lowering SLF reproductive potential. It also minimizes reliance on broad-spectrum chemical sprays, preserving soil health and lowering management costs.

## Proposed Direction: High-Reach Mechanical Crusher
**What it is:** A telescoping tool with a specialized head to scrape/crush egg masses and capture debris, eliminating direct contact or ladders. Features modular attachments for different surfaces.

**How it would be used:**

* User visually locates an out-of-reach egg mass.
* User extends the pole, positions the head, and actuates the head to grind/crush the mass.
* Debris is captured in a hopper or dispensed into a base container.

**Why this improves on the status quo:**

* Enables safe removal of high-reach masses (previously skipped or requiring ladders).
* Unifies scraping and collection, preventing missed eggs common in manual methods.

**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** A functional "working head" prototype on a fixed-length pole that demonstrates the ability to crush simulated egg masses on rough bark surfaces.

## Key risks / unknowns
**Host Plant Damage:** Aggressive mechanisms may damage vine bark/phloem; we will test the force required to crush eggs vs. damage plant matter. **User Fatigue:** A 10ft pole creates a large moment arm; we will test maximum comfortable weight. **Surface Variability:** Rigid tools may miss eggs in bark crevices; we will test compliant materials to ensure coverage on uneven surfaces.

## Questions for the client
1. **Do your workers currently skip egg masses that are out of reach, or do they use ladders?**
   *Decision affected:* Validates if "high-reach" is a critical safety requirement vs. a convenience.
2. **What types of surfaces do farmers often find egg masses on besides trees?**
   *Decision affected:* Determines extension length and modular attachment requirements.
